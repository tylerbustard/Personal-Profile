You are an expert Excel automation engineer. I am providing you with the current prototype Excel workbook (described in the XML format below). Your task is to refine and expand this prototype to fully reconstruct the word-for-word Question 1 Response 1 from the inputs through improved atomization, categorization, parsing, routing, and assembly. Fix issues like "Mismatch" in Assembly, "✗" in Outputs, partial reconstruction (currently only opening paragraph), and incomplete coherence checks. Ensure the system achieves an exact match for the full Response 1. Keep it formula-only (Excel 365 features), modular, and scalable.
Break this into 6 manageable sections, completing each before moving to the next. Output the updated prototype as a downloadable Excel file (.xlsx) with enhancements, including comments on new/changed formulas.
Section 1: Review and Update Inputs Sheet
Load the existing Inputs sheet. Ensure A2 has the full Case text, B2 full Instruction, C2 full Question Stem 1, D2 full Response 1. Add a drop-down in E2 (DATA VALIDATION: "Theoretical", "Economic", "Scholarly", "Conversational") to select style, tagging it as "{{Style-Selected}}". Update notes to reflect full response handling.
Section 2: Enhance Atomization in Parsing Sheet
Expand atomization to cover the entire Response 1 (aim for ~350 atoms). Use TEXTSPLIT(D2," ") on Inputs!D2, then improve tagging in column B with more precise IF/SEARCH (e.g., detect "value creation" as separate "{{Noun-Value}}" + "{{Verb-Creation}}"). Add column F for sub-concept joining (e.g., LET to combine adjacent atoms if proximity <3 words). Update coherence check in G2 to count full atoms and flag if <90% coverage.
Section 3: Refine Category Sheets (Verbs, Nouns, Connectors, Adjectives, Styles)
Populate each sheet with 100+ atoms (add more from Response 1 breakdown, e.g., in Nouns: "{{Noun-Vertical}}", "{{Noun-Integration}}"). Add a new column D for dynamic matching: FILTER to pull atoms based on Parsing tags. Fix incomplete rows (e.g., in Nouns, ensure all matched atoms like "Resource" link to RBV). Create a new "Evaluations" sheet for atoms like "{{Eval-ValueCreate}}" (assembled dynamically).
Section 4: Improve Routing Logic Sheet
Enhance parsing of Question Stem 1 in column A: Use TEXTSPLIT and nested SEARCH to detect all elements (e.g., "explain using two... create value... long-run profit" → tags "{{Verb-Explain}}", "{{Sub-ValueCreate}}", "{{Sub-LongRunProfit}}"). In column C, route to all relevant category sheets (e.g., "theories" → Nouns-Theory and Verbs-Explain). Integrate style drop-down from Inputs: IF E2="Theoretical", prioritize formal atoms. Add substitution for Case elements (e.g., "{{Firm}}" → "Terra"). Update check in row 17 to "✓ Routed (full elements)".
Section 5: Upgrade Assembly Formulas for Full Reconstruction
In Assembly sheet, extend formulas to rebuild the entire Response 1: Use LET to pull atoms from category sheets via XLOOKUP(routing tags), sequence by position (SEQUENCE + SORTBY), and TEXTJOIN with connectors/punctuation. Handle sections (e.g., row3: opening, row5: theory intro) with IF for stem-specific structure (e.g., if "{{Verb-Explain}}", start with "From a {{Noun-Theory}} perspective"). Adjust for selected style (e.g., add casual connectors if "Conversational"). Fix "Mismatch" by comparing LEN(assembled) to LEN(target). Spill full paragraphs in column C.
Section 6: Final Outputs, Validation, and Scalability
In Outputs sheet, spill the full assembled response in B4 (exact match to D2 on Inputs). Enhance validation in column C: Use EXACT(assembled, target) for "✓ Exact Match" or list differences. Update scalability notes in rows 23-28 with formulas for potential (e.g., "Extend to 16 responses via SEQUENCE(4,4)"). Add a summary in A30: IF all "✓", "Prototype Successful", "Needs Fix". Export the updated workbook.
