Goal: Make Google show the site name “Tyler Bustard” (not “Tyler - Bustard”) and use your headshot as the favicon in search results for https://tylerbustard.ca.
What to build (exact steps & code):
Update the head of your home page (index.html at the domain root)
Use this <head> (copy/paste). Replace only the og:image URL with your preferred social/share image if needed.
   <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

  <!-- Page title (keep the brand exactly as your preferred site name) -->
  <title>Tyler Bustard — Finance & Technology</title>

  <!-- Canonical home URL -->
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://tylerbustard.ca/" />

  <!-- Favicons (one stable URL per hostname) -->
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="any" />
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="48x48" href="/favicon-48.png" />
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="192x192" href="/favicon-192.png" />
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff" />
  <link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest" />

  <!-- Open Graph (helps with social previews and is a secondary signal for site name) -->
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://tylerbustard.ca/" />
  <meta property="og:site_name" content="Tyler Bustard" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="Tyler Bustard — Finance & Technology" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://tylerbustard.ca/og-image.jpg" />

  <!-- Site name control for Google (most important signal) -->
  <script type="application/ld+json">
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "WebSite",
    "name": "Tyler Bustard",
    "alternateName": ["Tyler Bustard - Finance & Technology", "tylerbustard.ca"],
    "url": "https://tylerbustard.ca/"
  }
  </script>
</head>
   Why this matters: Google primarily uses WebSite structured data to understand your preferred site name and also looks at og:site_name, <title>, and on-page headings; keeping them consistent (“Tyler Bustard”) strengthens the signal. Google for Developers
Provide a crawlable favicon (your face pic)
Create a square crop of your headshot that still reads at 16–24px (tight crop, simple background, high contrast).
Export these exact files and place them at your project root in Replit:    /favicon.ico        (multi‑size .ico; include a 48x48 frame)
/favicon-48.png     (48x48 PNG)
/favicon-192.png    (192x192 PNG)
/apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 PNG)
/favicon-512.png    (512x512 PNG for the web manifest)
  
Keep the file URLs stable (don’t rename them between deploys). Ensure they are publicly accessible (HTTP 200), not blocked by robots.txt. Google supports one favicon per hostname and recommends ≥48×48px for quality. Google for Developers
Add a minimal web app manifest (optional but tidy)
Create /site.webmanifest:
   {
  "name": "Tyler Bustard",
  "short_name": "Tyler Bustard",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#ffffff",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/favicon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "/favicon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
  ]
}
  
Robots + sitemap (keep the homepage crawlable)
Create /robots.txt:
   User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://tylerbustard.ca/sitemap.xml
  
Make sure your homepage and the favicon files are not disallowed. Google needs to crawl the home page and the favicon to show the icon. Google for Developers
Content consistency
Ensure your homepage’s visible H1 also uses “Tyler Bustard” (no hyphen split). Google considers homepage text as another signal for the site name. Google for Developers
Deploy, then validate & nudge Google
Validate structured data: Use the Schema Markup Validator to confirm the WebSite JSON‑LD has name and url, and (optionally) alternateName. (The Rich Results Test doesn’t check site names.) Google for Developers
Request a recrawl of your homepage in Search Console → URL Inspection → Request indexing after you deploy. This is the official way to let Google pick up the new favicon and site name sooner. Google for Developers

Notes tied to Google’s guidance (for your records)
Site name control: Put WebSite structured data on the home page of the domain you want the name for, keep the name consistent across signals, and use alternateName as a fallback if needed. Subdirectories don’t get their own site names. Google for Developers
Favicon requirements: Square icon, at least 8×8px (recommended ≥48×48px), one favicon per hostname (e.g., www vs. a subdomain can differ), must be crawlable by Googlebot/Googlebot‑Image, and use a stable URL. Google for Developers
Getting changes picked up: Use Search Console’s URL Inspection → Request Indexing on the homepage after updates (you must be a verified property owner). Google for Developers

Quick checklist for Replit
Root index.html uses the <head> above.
Headline/H1 shows “Tyler Bustard”.
Favicon assets uploaded at root with stable filenames (/favicon.ico, /favicon-48.png, etc.).
/robots.txt allows crawling; sitemap referenced if you have one.
Search Console: request indexing for https://tylerbustard.ca/.
